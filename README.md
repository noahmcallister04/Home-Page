### Basic Infromation About Myself:
**Background:** I was born and raised in St. Charles County, which is about an hour from St. Louis.
I attended Fort Zumwalt West Highschool and took a basic web design and intro to python class. I've always known I wanted to do something with computers and technology and I enjoy learning about coding and software engineering in my college classes.

**Interests:** As stated before I have always been interested in computers and technology. In middle school I would experiment in graphic design and video editing and often collaborate with small youtube channels to create their artwork. Since then I have lost interest in the media side and would like to persue software engineering.
